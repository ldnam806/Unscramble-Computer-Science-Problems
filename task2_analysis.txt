Time Complexity: O(n)

Iterating through calls data: We iterate through each call record in the data. Suppose there are n call records in the data. Therefore, the time complexity of iterating through the calls data is O(n).
Processing each call record: For each call record, we split the timestamp to extract the month and year, which takes constant time. We also update the total call durations in the phone_time dictionary, which takes constant time for each update. Therefore, the time complexity of processing each call record is O(1).
Finding the telephone number with the longest total call duration: We use the max() function to find the maximum value in the phone_time dictionary,
which has k entries (where k is the number of unique telephone numbers). Finding the maximum value in a dictionary takes linear time proportional to the number of entries in the dictionary, i.e., O(k).

Overall, the time complexity of the code is dominated by the step of iterating through the calls data, which is: O(n).
