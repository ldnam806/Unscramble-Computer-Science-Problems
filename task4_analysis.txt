- Therefore, the time complexity of loading data from both CSV files is O(n+m).
- Creating sets from the loaded data involves adding each item to a set.
- Suppose there are x unique numbers in the calls data and y unique numbers in the texts data.
- Adding each item to a set takes constant time on average (considering hashing).
- Therefore, the time complexity of creating sets for calls and texts is O(x+y).
- Identifying potential telemarketers:
- Subtracting sets to identify potential telemarketers involves set operations which take linear time relative to the size of the sets involved.
- In this case, the operation involves subtracting sets of numbers involved in texts and incoming calls from the set of outgoing call numbers.
- Suppose there are p outgoing call numbers and q numbers involved in texts and incoming calls.
- Therefore, the time complexity of identifying potential telemarketers is O(p+q).
- Sorting potential telemarketers:
  Sorting the potential telemarketers takes O(klogk) time, where k is the number of potential telemarketers.
  Overall, the dominant time complexity in the code is creating sets for calls and texts, as well as identifying potential telemarketers, which is O(x+y+p+q). Sorting the potential telemarketers adds an additional 
  O(klogk) time complexity, where k is the number of potential telemarketers.
- Therefore, the Big O for the provided code is: O(n+m+x+y+p+q+klogk).
