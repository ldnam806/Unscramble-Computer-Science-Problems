Task0:
#Printing the first record of texts.
#Printing the last record of calls.
For each operation:

Accessing specific elements of the texts and calls lists takes constant time, denoted as O(1).
Printing also typically takes constant time.
Since both operations have constant time complexity, the overall time complexity of the provided code is: O(1).

In summary, the code has a constant time complexity, meaning its execution time does not depend on the size of the input (the length of the texts and calls lists).

Task1:
Time Complexity: O(n)

In represents the total number of records in both the texts and calls lists
The code iterates through all records once and performs constant-time operations within the loop, resulting in linear time complexity.

In summary, the code has linear time complexity, meaning its execution time grows linearly with the number of records in the input.

Task2:
Time Complexity: O(n)

Iterating through calls data: We iterate through each call record in the data. Suppose there are n call records in the data. Therefore, the time complexity of iterating through the calls data is O(n).
Processing each call record: For each call record, we split the timestamp to extract the month and year, which takes constant time. We also update the total call durations in the phone_time dictionary, which takes constant time for each update. Therefore, the time complexity of processing each call record is O(1).
Finding the telephone number with the longest total call duration: We use the max() function to find the maximum value in the phone_time dictionary,
which has k entries (where k is the number of unique telephone numbers). Finding the maximum value in a dictionary takes linear time proportional to the number of entries in the dictionary, i.e., O(k).

Overall, the time complexity of the code is dominated by the step of iterating through the calls data, which is: O(n).

Task3:
Part A:
  Iterating through the calls list: O(n)  where n is the number of calls.
  Checking and adding area codes and mobile prefixes: O(1) for each call.
  Printing the list of codes: O(klogk), where k is the number of unique codes.
  Total time complexity for Part A: O(n+klogk).
Part B:
  Counting calls made from Bangalore to other fixed lines in Bangalore: O(n).
  Counting total calls made from Bangalore: O(n). 
  Calculating the percentage: O(1).
  Total time complexity for Part B: O(n).

Storing unique codes: O(k), where k is the number of unique codes.
Storing calls list: O(n), where n is the number of calls.
Overall: O(n+k).

In summary, the algorithm's time complexity is O(n+klogk) and its space complexity is O(n+k), where n is the number of calls and k is the number of unique codes.

Task4:
- Therefore, the time complexity of loading data from both CSV files is O(n+m).
- Creating sets from the loaded data involves adding each item to a set.
- Suppose there are x unique numbers in the calls data and y unique numbers in the texts data.
- Adding each item to a set takes constant time on average (considering hashing).
- Therefore, the time complexity of creating sets for calls and texts is O(x+y).
- Identifying potential telemarketers:
- Subtracting sets to identify potential telemarketers involves set operations which take linear time relative to the size of the sets involved.
- In this case, the operation involves subtracting sets of numbers involved in texts and incoming calls from the set of outgoing call numbers.
- Suppose there are p outgoing call numbers and q numbers involved in texts and incoming calls.
- Therefore, the time complexity of identifying potential telemarketers is O(p+q).
- Sorting potential telemarketers:
  Sorting the potential telemarketers takes O(klogk) time, where k is the number of potential telemarketers.
  Overall, the dominant time complexity in the code is creating sets for calls and texts, as well as identifying potential telemarketers, which is O(x+y+p+q). Sorting the potential telemarketers adds an additional 
  O(klogk) time complexity, where k is the number of potential telemarketers.
- Therefore, the Big O for the provided code is: O(n+m+x+y+p+q+klogk).
