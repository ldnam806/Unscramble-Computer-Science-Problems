Time Complexity: O(n)

n represents the total number of records in both the texts and calls lists
The code iterates through all records once and performs constant-time operations within the loop, resulting in linear time complexity.

In summary, the code has linear time complexity, meaning its execution time grows linearly with the number of records in the input.
