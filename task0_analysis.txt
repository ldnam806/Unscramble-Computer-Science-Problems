#Printing the first record of texts.
#Printing the last record of calls.
For each operation:

Accessing specific elements of the texts and calls lists takes constant time, denoted as O(1).
Printing also typically takes constant time.
Since both operations have constant time complexity, the overall time complexity of the provided code is: O(1).

In summary, the code has a constant time complexity, meaning its execution time does not depend on the size of the input (the length of the texts and calls lists).
