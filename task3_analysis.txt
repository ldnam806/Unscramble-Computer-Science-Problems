Part A:
  Iterating through the calls list: O(n)  where n is the number of calls.
  Checking and adding area codes and mobile prefixes: O(1) for each call.
  Printing the list of codes: O(klogk), where k is the number of unique codes.
  Total time complexity for Part A: O(n+klogk).
Part B:
  Counting calls made from Bangalore to other fixed lines in Bangalore: O(n).
  Counting total calls made from Bangalore: O(n). 
  Calculating the percentage: O(1).
  Total time complexity for Part B: O(n).

Storing unique codes: O(k), where k is the number of unique codes.
Storing calls list: O(n), where n is the number of calls.
Overall: O(n+k).

In summary, the algorithm's time complexity is O(n+klogk) and its space complexity is O(n+k), where n is the number of calls and k is the number of unique codes.
